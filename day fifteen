IN C :
#include<stdio.h>

int main () {
    int year; 
    printf("Enter the year: "); 
    scanf("%d", &year);
    
    if(year % 100 == 0) { 
        printf("%d is a century year.\n", year);
    } 
    else if (year % 50 == 0) { 
        printf("%d is a half-century year.\n", year);  
    } 
    else {
        printf("%d is neither a century year nor a half-century year.\n", year);  
    }

    return 0;
}

O/P:
2000 is a century year.
1950 is a half-century year.
2023 is neither a century year nor a half-century year.

   return f"{year} is a century year."
elif year % 50 == 0:
   return f"{year} is a half century year."
else:
   return f"{year} is neither a century year nor a half century year "
year = int(input("Enter the year : "))
print(check_year(year)) 

O/P:
