day 48 of crew matrix :program to find the first three factors of a given number:

IN C :
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num, count = 0;
    
    // Taking input from the user
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);

    printf("First three factors of %d are: ", num);

    // Loop to find the first three factors
    for (int i = 1; i <= num && count < 3; i++) {
        if (num % i == 0) {
            printf("%d ", i);
            count++;
        }
    }

    // If less than 3 factors found
    if (count < 3) {
        printf("\nThe number has less than 3 factors.");
    }

    return 0;
}

O/p :
Enter a number: 12
First three factors of 12 are: 1 2 3

Enter a number: 7
First three factors of 7 are: 1 7 
The number has less than 3 factors.

IN PYTHON:
# Function to find and print the first three factors of a number
def first_three_factors(num):
    count = 0
    print(f"First three factors of {num} are: ", end="")
    
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        if num % i == 0:
            print(i, end=" ")
            count += 1
        if count == 3:
            break
    
    if count < 3:
        print(f"\nThe number {num} has less than 3 factors.")

# Taking input from the user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
first_three_factors(num)

O/P:
Enter a number: 15
First three factors of 15 are: 1 3 5

Enter a number: 7
First three factors of 7 are: 1 7 
The number 7 has less than 3 factors.
