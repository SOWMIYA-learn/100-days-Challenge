day 60 : program that checks whether two characters entered by the user are the same or different

IN C :
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char char1, char2;

    // Input two characters from the user
    printf("Enter the first character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &char1);
    
    printf("Enter the second character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &char2);

    // Check if the characters are the same or different
    if (char1 == char2) {
        printf("The characters '%c' and '%c' are the SAME.\n", char1, char2);
    } else {
        printf("The characters '%c' and '%c' are DIFFERENT.\n", char1, char2);
    }

    return 0;
}

O/P :
Enter the first character: a
Enter the second character: a
The characters 'a' and 'a' are the SAME.

Enter the first character: a
Enter the second character: b
The characters 'a' and 'b' are DIFFERENT.

IN PYTHON:
# Input two characters from the user
char1 = input("Enter the first character: ")
char2 = input("Enter the second character: ")

# Check if the characters are the same or different
if char1 == char2:
    print(f"The characters '{char1}' and '{char2}' are the SAME.")
else:
    print(f"The characters '{char1}' and '{char2}' are DIFFERENT.")

O/P :
Enter the first character: a
Enter the second character: a
The characters 'a' and 'a' are the SAME.

Enter the first character: a
Enter the second character: b
The characters 'a' and 'b' are DIFFERENT.
