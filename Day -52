day 52 of crew matrix: program to check if a given number is a multiple of two numbers,  

IN C :
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int number, N1, N2;

    // Input the number to be checked
    printf("Enter the number to check: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);

    // Input the two numbers
    printf("Enter the first number (N1): ");
    scanf("%d", &N1);

    printf("Enter the second number (N2): ");
    scanf("%d", &N2);

    // Check if 'number' is a multiple of both N1 and N2
    if (number % N1 == 0 && number % N2 == 0) {
        printf("%d is a multiple of both %d and %d.\n", number, N1, N2);
    } else {
        printf("%d is not a multiple of both %d and %d.\n", number, N1, N2);
    }

    return 0;
}

O/P:
Enter the number to check: 24
Enter the first number (N1): 3
Enter the second number (N2): 4
24 is a multiple of both 3 and 4.

Enter the number to check: 25
Enter the first number (N1): 3
Enter the second number (N2): 4
25 is not a multiple of both 3 and 4.

IN PYTHON:
# Input the number to be checked
number = int(input("Enter the number to check: "))

# Input the two numbers
N1 = int(input("Enter the first number (N1): "))
N2 = int(input("Enter the second number (N2): "))

# Check if 'number' is a multiple of both N1 and N2
if number % N1 == 0 and number % N2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is a multiple of both {N1} and {N2}.")
else:
    print(f"{number} is not a multiple of both {N1} and {N2}.")

O/P:
Enter the number to check: 24
Enter the first number (N1): 3
Enter the second number (N2): 4
24 is a multiple of both 3 and 4.

Enter the number to check: 25
Enter the first number (N1): 3
Enter the second number (N2): 4
25 is not a multiple of both 3 and 4.
